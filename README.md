# Go Web Application with PostgreSQL and Session Management

Description
This Go-based web application demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to building a web server that handles HTTP requests, interacts with a PostgreSQL database, and manages user sessions. It includes functionality for user authentication, session management, and CRUD operations on blog entries, showcasing the use of GORM for database operations, Gorilla Sessions for session handling, and the Go Playground Validator for input validation.
